# Symmetric Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, __check whether it is a mirror of itself__ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](symtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 1](symtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 
**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
